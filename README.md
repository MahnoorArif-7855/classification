# AI Model Deployment Using Streamlit

This project demonstrates a machine learning model deployed using the **Streamlit** framework. It allows users to interact with the model and view predictions without needing to write or manage HTML, CSS, or JavaScript code. The main focus of this project is simplicity and accessibility, making it easy for developers to showcase machine learning models with an intuitive graphical user interface.

## Features

- **Interactive Input Sliders**: Users can adjust the input features using sliders, making it simple to test different values.
- **Dynamic Predictions**: As the input changes, the model dynamically updates its predictions and displays the results.
- **Streamlit Framework**: The entire application is built using Streamlit, removing the need for custom front-end development.
- **Responsive UI**: The app adjusts to different screen sizes, providing a smooth user experience.

## Model Overview

The AI model deployed in this project is a **classification model** trained on the Iris dataset to predict the species of a flower based on the following features:

1. **Sepal Length**
2. **Sepal Width**
3. **Petal Length**
4. **Petal Width**

The model predicts one of the three Iris species:
- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica
